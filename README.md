powdery_mildew_fungicide_record_database_SB_V7_Working.csv

Year: Classification variable for year of observation, 2014 to 2017.

Disease incidence: Seasonal mean incidence of plants with powdery mildew.

Disease incidence in May: Seasonal mean incidence of plants with powdery mildew in May.

Susceptibility_to_R6_Strains: Each cultivar an ordinal score for its susceptibility to pathogenic races of P. macularis with virulence Vb,V3,V4,V5,V6.

Susceptibility_to_nonR6_Strains: Each cultivar an ordinal score for its non-susceptibility to pathogenic races of P. macularis with virulence Vb,V3,V5.

Pruning: Thoroughness of spring pruning rated using a 1 to 5 ordinal scale. In this ordinal scale, ‘1’ represents the most thorough pruning which removed all green leaves and stems from every plant. Each subsequent point represents an approximation of the incidence of plants with green foliage remaining such that a ‘5’ indicates that >80% of plants had green leaves and shoots remaining after pruning.

FlagShoot_Incidence: Seasonal mean incidence of bud infection which might cause shoots emerging from winter dormancy colonized by P. macularis.

Spray date: Respective application use days from New Year’s Day

First spray date: First application use days from New Year’s Day

Synthetic: Dummy variable whether growers used synthetic fungicides

Non-synthetic: Dummy variable whether growers used non-synthetic fungicides

Mixture: Dummy variable whether growers used both synthetic and non-synthetic fungicides
