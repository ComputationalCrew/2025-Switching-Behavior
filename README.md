The data and codes available here accompany the paper: Hwang et al. 202X. Fungicide Selection, Disease Risk, and Grower Switching Behavior.

powdery_mildew_fungicide_record_database_SB_V7_Working.csv

year: Classification variable for year of observation, 2014 to 2017.

mildew.incidence: Seasonal mean incidence of plants with powdery mildew.

disease.in.may: Seasonal mean incidence of plants with powdery mildew in May.

susceptibility.to.r6.Strains: Each cultivar an ordinal score for its susceptibility to pathogenic races of P. macularis with virulence Vb,V3,V4,V5,V6.

susceptibility.to.nonr6.Strains: Each cultivar an ordinal score for its non-susceptibility to pathogenic races of P. macularis with virulence Vb,V3,V5.

Pruning: Thoroughness of spring pruning rated using a 1 to 5 ordinal scale. In this ordinal scale, ‘1’ represents the most thorough pruning which removed all green leaves and stems from every plant. Each subsequent point represents an approximation of the incidence of plants with green foliage remaining such that a ‘5’ indicates that >80% of plants had green leaves and shoots remaining after pruning.

flagshoot: Seasonal mean incidence of bud infection which might cause shoots emerging from winter dormancy colonized by P. macularis.

spray.date: Respective application use days from New Year’s Day

first.spray.date: First application use days from New Year’s Day

Synthetic: A dummy variable coded as 1 or 0 to use synthetic fungicides

Non-synthetic: A dummy variable coded as 1 or 0 to use non-synthetic fungicides

change: A dummy variable coded as 1 or 0 to switch behavior

how: A variable how a grower changed from previous spray to current spray

Grower: A factor variable that used fungicide program, from 1 to 8

mi: A dummy variable coded as 1 or 0 to represent the presence or absence of mildew.incidence variable.

Nonsynthetic: Predicted probability using fitted values for non-synthetic reference level

Synthetic: Predicted probability using fitted values for synthetic reference level

Mixture: Predicted probability using fitted values for mixture reference level
